### TODO: setup.py

<hr>

## Installation

### Run setup.py to install relevant packages (TODO) using Python 3.7

### *Requires pymongo, irc, requests*

#### Link database (mongodb) to bot launcher using python 3.6 or later connection string

#### Name the database as Main

#### Create 3 Collections named Bots, Channels, Config

#### Look in Examples folder for format of documents in each collection, named accordingly

#### Add all config documents, at least one bot and channel, and a default channel document for reverting to default settings

##### Configurable options are marked with $ prefix

##### $oid will be generated by document creation, not required to be filled in when creating documents

##### A channel needs to be linked to a bot in the bot document by entering the bot name in the channel document

<hr>

## Usage

#### For every bot in your channel in your database, an instance will launch using the bot declared in the bot entry

##### Executing Launcher.py will do this

##### I would recommend launching within an IDE so that errors can be recorded and sent back to me should they arise

#### !stats [platform] [target player]

#### !mains [platform] [target player]
